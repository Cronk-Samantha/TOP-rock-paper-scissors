# TOP-rock-paper-scissors

This is one of The Odin Project's practice project with javascript. I had to write out a program that accepts user input & stores it, generates a random choice from the computer & stores it, create a function that plays 1 round of rock, paper, scissors, and finally create a function that loops through the game 5 times and declares a final winner. This was great practice for me working with js and understanding loops, conditionals, and built-in functions. So far, this game can only be played via the dev tools browser but hopefully I can go back and style the html/css to make it a game the user plays directly on the browser! Take a look around and let me know if there's places in my code I can improve :)
